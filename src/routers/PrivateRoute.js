// aside from the two: isAuthenticated and component. On the next line starting with <Route

// via {...rest}.
// Also note that we want to make sure all props passed to Route are passed to the 
// individual component. This is then followed with  a condition.
// If user is authenticated then render the component with the props for that route.
// If user is not auththenticated redirect them to login page.
