// is being able to export history and using it in other files, specifically, 
// those that are not registered as a route (eg  app.js).

// Note that the <Route /> component that was replaced by <PrivateRoute> below, 
// now lives in PrivateRoute.js.  PrivateRoute.js renders a conditional Route and receives 
// the parms below as props from <PrivateRoute>.
